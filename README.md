### What I learned

How to use *after* pseudoelement to decorate. Credits to [Florin Pop](https://youtu.be/PcSUEo0P0GU).
This is the css code used to create the top borders:

```css
.card {
    background-color: white;
    width: 350px;
    padding: 2rem;
    margin: 1rem;
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0 6px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.card::after {
    background-color: red;
    content: "";
    height: 5px;
    width: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
```
